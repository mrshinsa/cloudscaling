Take Home Code Challenge

After getting familiar with python and git, do the following exercise:

Rules

1. Upon starting you have 2 hours to complete as many milestones as possible (it is fine if
you don't finish all of them)
2. Put the results in a git repository that I can access (extra points if it the repo isn’t hosted
on a website)
3. Use python and only the following modules: socket, string, os, mimetypes
4. Open book, open notes, open Internet
5. After each milestone, commit the file to your repository
6. You have 48 hours to send us the results along with:
○ Your level of familiarity with python, git, and web servers
○ How long it took you to complete
○ A short description of how you developed the solution
○ A description of the known problems you found but ran out of time to fix, and how
you could fix them given more time

Goal: "Build a web server which serves content and supports directory indices"

Milestones

1. Build a simple socket server
2. Build a TCP socket server that will display a static HTML page in response to a GET
request from any modern web browser
3. Modify the above server to return the current directory contents
4. Be able to traverse the directory tree by clicking on the folders
5. Serve images and HTML documents
